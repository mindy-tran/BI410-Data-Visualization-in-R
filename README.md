# BI410-Data-Visualization-in-R
This course covers the non-statistical aspects of the data life cycle, including how to store, clean, visualize and communicate data (Figure 1). It is intended as a complement to statistics courses - we will cover how to get your data into shape for analysis, and how to communicate your findings visually. It is primarily a methods class and will be taught in R (but there is no expectation that students know R coming in).
